Solve it once LLC is seeking a business relationship with one or more freelance marketing specialists and SEOs for 1099-based
consultation on an as-needed basis. This is **fully remote** work, though we'd love to meet up occasionally with
any freelance partners local to Detroit.

## Description

An ideal candidate for this role:

  * Has a track record of client success to share
  * Is able to attend meetings from time to time, usually during business hours in the Eastern US time zone
  * Avoids shady techniques and dark patterns without having to be asked
  * Focuses on getting results over generating paperwork
  * Can do some coding, but also knows when to ask a developer for help
  * Loves solving interesting problems

## Responsibilities

The full gamut of responsibilities will be as varied as our client base, but we anticipate asking you for the following
regularly:

  * Keyword research and recommended phrases
  * Reports on analytics as available, with a handful of top-line opportunities
  * Paid ad strategies
  * Paid ad implementation, potentially commissioned
  * Social/viral/influencer strategies
  * Recommendations and implementation details for landing pages and other marketing techniques
  * Business analysis and consultation

## Expected rate and volume

It's negotiable and based on level of experience, but currently we'd expect around **$70 USD per hour**, invoiced monthly.
At present it's unknown how many hours per month to plan for us to send your way, but a big priority would be to communicate
early and often about our incoming opportunities and your availability.

The so1ve product offering is an evolving organism, and an opportunity exists to begin doing work on an hourly basis, but
to later pivot toward a fixed-fee product offering alongside Solve it once's development services.
