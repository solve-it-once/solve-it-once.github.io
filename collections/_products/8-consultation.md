## Service description

If you run a web agency or a small business with web-related problems to solve (once!), you are in the right place.

A single hour or small bucket of hours is available until completely used, as long as used within two years of purchase.
If you do not yet have a set purpose for the hours but wish to reserve some for a later date, _Solve it once_ can keep track
of your remaining time balance. _Solve it once_ may be forced to raise hourly rates in the future, too, so preemptively
buying some hours now may save you some marginal cost.

Since problem-solving tasks require estimates and sometimes go over those estimates, we (_Solve it once_) cannot represent
that any hour or hours purchased will result in a particular completed task, unless the required time to complete is well-known.

Here are some things we can likely tackle for you in an hour or so:

  * Discuss your business's current status and figure out the current and near-future problems you may face
  * Determine opportunities in the SEO, paid media, analytics, A/B testing, or other web-adjacent realms
  * Delve into a single problem and put some detail around it. Give your enemy a name and show you its face
  * Identify next steps and generate some amount of strategy for tackling a small problem
  * Demonstrate one or more overhead-eliminating techniques for a more streamlined small business
  * Compare your company's operations to those I've encountered in subcontracting the last few years, for opportunities to compete
  * Look at your technology stack for new or existing projects, and identify pain points and their alternatives
  * Tweak project management, client relations, resourcing, and other approaches that can markedly affect morale
  * Strategize tactics for blending in-office, hybrid, remote, and contract/outsourced resources while retaining trust
  * Brainstorm a full-organization or departmental strategic plan for the next five years (though a full plan will be more than an hour)
  * Drupal from a business perspective, as opposed to [development hours](/products/work-by-the-hour/)
  * And lots more!

Consultation hours can be used for anything within reason, as long as we're on the same page about the work being time-limited.
If you'd like to purchase an hour or two via the website and then request monthly invoicing for any hours used beyond the
initial purchase, we are happy to oblige.

## What you can expect next

Once you use the checkout process, you'll hear from us via email:

1. You will receive an email at your billing contact address with a link to a brief form for the most vital information
    needed to start work, such as the nature of the web business problem you're looking to solve once
2. After you've filled out the brief form, Brad will reach out with a small amount of legwork based on your responses, and
    will likely work with you to set up a time to do a video call to discuss your needs and the structure of a solution
    in more detail

Please note that single consultation hours and small buckets of purchased hours are treated with less priority than larger
segments of work that other clients purchase in a similar timeframe, so there may be significant delays for this product.
Whenever possible, _Solve it once_ will let you know of any changes to the estimated delivery date of work hours.

## Your Satisfaction

We strive to deliver the best solutions to our clients’ needs at reasonable costs. If there’s a way we (an open, honest,
ethically-minded small business) can help improve your outcome without excessive cost to _Solve it once_, you need only
ask:

  * Technology demonstrations
  * Our internal documentation
  * Rate negotiation
  * Boilerplate content

<h2 class="color--third">The last word</h2>

Thank you so much for reviewing this product proposal for one or more consultation hours. We hope it was a worthwhile
use of your time, and sincerely look forward to working with you.

One quick thing: All the products for sale on this site are packages of service hours. I will email a copy of _Solve it once_'s
Form W9 to all customers, and (noting that I'm not a lawyer or accountant and this isn't legal or financial advice) if you
pay _Solve it once_ $600 or more in a calendar year, you should submit a corresponding 1099.
