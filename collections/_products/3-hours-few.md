## Service description

If you need a web developer that specializes in Drupal and the JAMstack for between an hour and a day of work, you are in
the right place.

A single hour or small bucket of hours is available until completely used, as long as used within two years of purchase.
If you do not yet have a set purpose for the hours but wish to reserve some for a later date, _Solve it once_ can keep track
of your remaining time balance. _Solve it once_ may be forced to raise hourly rates in the future, too, so preemptively
buying some hours now may save you some marginal cost.

Since web development tasks require estimates and sometimes/often go over those estimates, we (_Solve it once_) cannot represent
that any hour or hours purchased will result in a particular completed task, unless the required time to complete is well-known.
Also of note: if this is your first time using _Solve it once_ for work on a particular site, it could take an hour or more
to set up a code repository mirror and local development environment before beginning on task work, so you likely will want
to purchase an hour more than you believe any task work will take.

Here are some things we can likely tackle for you in an hour or so:

  * Review codebase and provide some general sentiments and specific areas for improvement
  * Set up a local development environment and code repository mirror
  * Run automated performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices tests on the front end, and give rough estimates for priority fixes
  * Attend a meeting, either participating or silently writing feedback, at your discretion
  * Perform routine Drupal updates to core (same major version) and contributed code and do limited "smoke testing" of overall site operation
  * Peek into your analytics and find a handful of insights for future marketing and code improvements
  * Fix a single backend or frontend bug, especially if clearly replicable and not a showstopper
  * Make simple tweaks to a frontend theme, such as updating color hex codes for a rebrand

Development hours can be used for anything, as long as we're on the same page about the work being time-limited. If you'd
like to purchase an hour or two via the website and then request monthly invoicing for any hours used beyond the initial
purchase, we are happy to oblige.

If you anticipate needing 10 or more hours of work in the not-too-distant future, [a block of hours](/products/block-of-hours/)
or [a full sprint of work](/products/sprint/) will be a better deal.

## What you can expect next

Once you use the checkout process, you'll hear from us via email:

1. You will receive an email at your billing contact address with a link to a brief form for the most vital information
    needed to start work, such as the site URL, access details for the codebase, any known details around setting up a development
    environment, and a quick write-up of the desired work
2. If we've worked together on this site before, _Solve it once_ can likely get started on the work, based entirely on your
    form responses. If this is your first time working with _so1ve_ or a site of yours we've never worked on, we'll likely
    have to follow up

Please note that single development hours and small buckets of purchased hours are treated with less priority than larger
segments of work that other clients purchase in a similar timeframe, so there may be significant delays for this product.
Whenever possible, _Solve it once_ will let you know of any changes to the estimated delivery date of work hours.

## Your Satisfaction

We strive to deliver the best solutions to our clients’ needs at reasonable costs. If there’s a way we (an open, honest,
ethically-minded small business) can help improve your outcome without excessive cost to _Solve it once_, you need only
ask:

  * Technology demonstrations
  * Our internal documentation
  * Rate negotiation
  * Boilerplate content

<h2 class="color--third">The last word</h2>

Thank you so much for reviewing this product proposal for one or more web development hours. We hope it was a worthwhile
use of your time, and sincerely look forward to working with you.

One quick thing: All the products for sale on this site are packages of service hours. I will email a copy of _Solve it once_'s
Form W9 to all customers, and (noting that I'm not a lawyer or accountant and this isn't legal or financial advice) if you
pay _Solve it once_ $600 or more in a calendar year, you should submit a corresponding 1099.
