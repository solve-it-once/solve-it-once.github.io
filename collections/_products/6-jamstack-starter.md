## Cover letter

  <aside class="layout--column flex--3 padding-horizontal--4 padding-horizontal--collapse">
    <p>Dear new client,</p>

    <p>Even a huge head-start like <a href="https://github.com/lowerbarriers/finished-starter">finished-starter</a> requires
      more than 2 hours of earnest effort to be fully customized. While the software at the end of the 2-hour engagement
      will technically be <em>launchable</em>, you probably won't want to.
    </p>

    <p>If you're comfortable with doing most of your own coding and asset work, you could very well love the low lifetime
      cost of hosting and maintaining a site like this. But there are only so many reasons to go with this package over
      a <a href="/products/5-jamstack-full/">full JAMstack site package</a>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Opening a conversation using code, to resume later</li>
      <li>Paying Brad to do work you're capable of, to support his work on finished-starter</li>
      <li>Treating the site as Brad's signed artwork</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If we're on the same page about how you're mostly getting a free and open-source template and maybe an hour's worth
      of customization, we'd love to clone the repository for you and start a dialogue!
    </p>

    <p>With gratitude,</p>

## Brief examples

Your site will be distinct and will display your brand, but you can expect the same capabilities as these quick looks:

## An hour of customization

Once you use the checkout process (or [reach out](mailto:brad@solveitonce.com) to plan further and arrange alternate payment),
things will happen fast:

  1. You will receive an email at your billing contact address with a link to a brief form for the most vital information
   needed to start the project, such as your business/organization name, what you do, how you want your customization time
   spent, and who your main point of contact will be
  2. Brad will invite you to a shared drive where you can put your logo, any existing copy and other documents, images,
   and other assets. Brad will place training documentation and other useful pieces in this drive, as well
  3. Later that first day or early the next day, you'll get an email from Brad with:
     * A link to the prototype version of your new website
     * Instructions to create a GitHub account and send along your username, so you can own and manage the site going forward
  4. Around this time you'll get invited to the _Solve it once_ Slack. This is purely optional, but is an easy way to request
   support during and after the engagement
  5. Brad will do approximately one hour of development work, based on your form responses and provided files
  6. Approximately 2 business days (assuming Brad's availability) after purchase, the agreed-to development and content items
   will be completed and ready for launch. Depending on if your needs are more involved than an hour's worth, you may
   wish to plan [one or more follow-up sprints](/products/sprint/) before truly launching. But the site at the end of this
   engagement will be _working software_ that can be launched if desired

## How you can use your hour

The 2 customization hours can be used for development, planning, architecture, meetings, design, copywriting, testing, and
other vital work toward a launch-able site. Approximately 1 of the hours will inevitably go toward setting up the codebase
and other administrative items, so around 1 hour is reasonable to plan for some suggested items:

* Migrate content from an existing site or other source
* Refine site-wide styles and various components to better mesh with your brand and mood/tone
* Create image and video assets to go with text content
* Do branding and logo exercises and refine your web presence
* Create documentation and strategies
* Write copy for Home/About 'storytelling' pages
* Write (or revise from LLM-generated) blog posts with search engines in mind
* Revise the header and/or footer
* Create forms for collecting desired information from users
* Implement e-commerce functionality beyond the scaffolding already included with finished-starter
* Prepare for launch with the usual checklists, DNS switchovers, backups, and post-launch checks
* ...and more!

Mix and match items from above, or request specifically what you want us to focus on, for up to 2 hours of customization
to make the site precisely what you want, all in record time.

All of this content is worded in a generic manner that, if you forget to update it before launch, won't end up being a big,
embarrassing problem. There's no "Lorem Ipsum" for users to accidentally discover. And it's difficult to forget vital pages
every website should have, since they all get included at install-time.

### Meet finished-starter, your feature-packed site template

This is great code to copy if you want a full-fledged site out of the box on day one, that you can customize and extend
to suit your needs.

All the repetitive stuff for content, performance, SEO, accessibility, testing, etc. is done, so you can focus on what
makes your site special.

**Some of the wheels you won't have to reinvent**:

  * **Blog** — with pagers, categories, tags, and bylines
  * **Events** — with listings for current/future events and also past events
  * **Forms** — results sent to your email automatically. Also a mailchimp subscription form
  * **E-commerce** — products, cart, the whole deal ready to go
  * **Search** — it just works
  * **Pages and content** — Home, About, Privacy Policy, Terms and conditions, it's all there
  * **Atomic components** — Insert fancy components, including layouts, anywhere you want
  * **Accessibility** — Maybe not perfect <abbr title="Accessibility">a11y</abbr>, but we _try_ and care
  * **Icons** — Easy to use and accessible
  * **Vanilla code** — Better CSS than tailwind, less CSS needed than... anything!
  * **Feeds and SEO** — All of the tags and feeds you could want. Social share images, too
  * **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — Your site is offline-capable and installable on devices
  * **Performance** — Tons of optimizations to eke out extra milliseconds of speed
  * **Documentation** — A site with a design system and more docs than you'll believe

#### Features

The original version of this codebase gets four 100s in [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) testing,
has valid HTML per [the w3 validator](http://validator.w3.org/), and has zero errors per [the WAVE tool](https://wave.webaim.org/).
Also the following:

  * Most configuration in a single `_config.yml` file, for easy start-up (including Google Analytics and social links)
  * [Atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) implemented as consistent, templated includes, using
    [inclusive components](https://inclusive-components.design/) patterns where possible
  * JSON [Design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/) (compatible with [style-dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary))
    populate both the design system's CSS decisions and the automatic documentation
  * **Real HTML** generated by the static site generator, so users and search engines get content immediately and reliably
  * VS Code, [.editorconfig](https://github.com/lowerbarriers/finished-starter/blob/gh-pages/.editorconfig) and GitHub Codespaces settings for quick dev setup anywhere
  * All the trappings of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/):
    [markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) content, [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/),
    [Liquid templates](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/), GitHub builds, git revision tracking
  * Generous built-in documentation your team can use: style guide, components, UX, instructions
  * Print, `prefers-reduced-motion`, and dark mode styles already in place that you'll never need to touch
  * [Skip links](https://a11yproject.com/posts/skip-nav-links/) and plenty of other accessibility (a11y) optimizations
  * Dismissible alerts, both site-wide and reusable in content
  * Site works without JavaScript, with all features failing safe and [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement)

  * [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) as can be, with one-click Netlify compatibility (below)
  * [SVG icons embedded](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/) as components. [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/)
    and [social icons](https://simpleicons.org/) included out of the box
  * Zero front-end dependencies and _clever_ **vanilla JavaScript** so there's less code to write
  * Utility-first CSS using a syntax everyone on your team can fully memorize in less than five minutes
    (ex: `.font-style--italic`, `.background-color--main-dark`, and `.display--flex`)
  * "Vanilla CSS": full embrace of CSS custom properties that makes Sass unnecessary. Very flat
    [specificity graph](https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/specificity-graph/)
  * Clean break = [**no** Internet Explorer support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer-and-edge).
    It's the 2020s. Friendly conditional-comment message for IE users just in case
  * [webp](https://www.tecmint.com/convert-images-to-webp-format-in-linux/) and [avif](https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/)

  * All .github and open-source files written generically so you don't have to worry about them
  * Cookie consent sticky footer to aid GDPR and CCPA compliance
  * Copious code comments throughout, for the right information when you need it
  * JSON files of site content and settings available for quickly making javascript front ends if desired
  * Four pre-configured menus: utility, main, footer, copyright
  * Editor configs and linters in place for consistent code styles
  * **Test coverage**: behavioral-like "user story" test definitions for both human and automated verification

## What our customers say

(We don't request testimonials very frequently, but if you have strong feelings either way, we'll include your feedback
here for other clients to make an informed decision)

> Brad demonstrated a conscientious, dedicated, results oriented professional attitude while developing our Drupal portal.
> His deep knowledge and design skills became evident from day one. The people who have reviewed our portal immediately
> responded with a "WOW!" They liked the main page, font selection and layout. I highly recommend Solve It Once.

— Dennis L. Thomas, CEO, IQStrategix

## Testing and release

_Solve it once_ Quality Assurance (QA) will review the site on desktop/mobile/tablet to provide the team with feedback.
QA will be performed within the different environments to ensure that data, extensions, and features defined are functioning
as agreed upon. The client will need to test on staging and give final approval for launch.

Iterative quality assurance performed by _Solve it once_’s QA will ensure feature functionality and adherence to agreed-upon
requirements. QA will perform testing on individual tasks and smoke testing on the site as a whole at the end of the engagement.

The QA team will perform testing on the latest 2 versions of the following browsers:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* Edge

The site will be tested on the most recent versions of mobile and tablet devices for iPhone and Android.

## Project planning and management

_Solve it once_ will assign an engagement manager to the project, almost definitely Brad. The assigned manager will be the
primary point of contact for the project. _Solve it once_ follows agile methodologies for project management and delivery.

As described in the table, this will include:

<div class="table--wrapper">
  <table>
    <caption>Project management per-task details</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Task</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Project management</td>
        <td>The PM will be responsible for providing the following throughout the project at assigned intervals: Change
          Requests as needed, Deployments
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Meetings</td>
        <td>The PM will set up a check-in schedule cadence with the client to inform them of the project’s progress and
          communicate any additional information to the team
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Technical specifications</td>
        <td>Throughout the project, Solve it once may identify features or functionality that may require written specifications.
          These Tech Specs will be shared with the Client upon completion when appropriate.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Deployments and code management</td>
        <td>Code will be managed within Github. Work is completed in a Solve it once development environment and after Code
          Review and QA, it will be deployed to staging for the client to review. Once work from staging is approved, it
          will be deployed to production.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Work planning</td>
        <td>Strategic planning on how to approach tasks and scheduling the work to be completed.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Project Assumptions

Project schedule and price is based on the assumptions listed on this page, along with the following assumptions:

* The client is responsible for purchasing all third party extensions and providing necessary licenses and access to _Solve it once_.
* All client sign-offs and reviews must be completed within two business days.
* Upon final payment, the Client owns all deliverables and work products as a result of this engagement.
* The client will be provided with delivery dates for known assets, data, and/or tasks. Delivery dates that are missed
  by the client could result in delayed timelines and additional fees.
* As applicable, the client has agreed to provide copy/copywriting, visual assets (other than stock imagery, for which
  we will gravitate toward freely-licensed sources), and other non-development requirements
* _Solve it once_ may voluntarily help configure non-finished-starter services such as Mailchimp for expediency, but is
  not responsible for non-finished-starter development work
* The site theme will consist of standard components skinned with brand colors, fonts, and assets. Client is able to configure
  items like “hero background images” that have a large overall effect on the tone and feel of a given page. Design wireframes,
  mockups, prototypes, or comps will not be provided by _Solve it once_ unless factored into the planning, and,
  if provided by the client or a third party during this project, will only be considered for implementation as remaining
  time allows

## Roles and responsibilities

The _Solve it once_ team consists of a primary project contact, Brad, who will handle and liaise with project managers,
software developers, QA, and other internal parties as necessary.

The client teams should consist of a primary contact acting as client engagement manager.

## Project Dependencies

The following is a list of requirements and Client responsibilities necessary for the successful completion of this effort
and their respective delivery timeframes. _Solve it once_ has used this information in establishing the schedule and pricing
for the services.

* The client will provide a single point of contact to act as the client-side Engagement Manager for the project.
* Attend all meetings and conference calls as required.
* Respond to information requests in a timely manner and provide approvals within 2 business days.

## Change Management

Any items not specifically listed as in-scope following initial discussions and messages are considered out-of-scope for
this project. If the Client desires changes, additions or refinements to be made to the activities, timelines, deliverables
or milestones documented in the plan, the designated Client Engagement Manager must notify the _Solve it once_ Engagement
Manager.

Within 24 hours, the _Solve it once_ Engagement Manager will notify the Client if the change will impact the project scope,
timeline and/or cost. Once an estimate for the change is completed, the _Solve it once_ Engagement Manager will apprise
the Client Engagement Manager of the resulting schedule and cost impact of the requested changes.

Changes to the project scope, timeline and/or cost will be documented via a Change Request Form as provided. The Client
Engagement Manager and _Solve it once_ Engagement Manager must sign-off on the Change Request Form before it will be implemented.

## Your Satisfaction

We strive to deliver the best solutions to our clients’ needs at reasonable costs. If there’s a way we (an open, honest,
ethically-minded small business) can help improve your outcome without excessive cost to _Solve it once_, you need only
ask:

* Technology demonstrations
* Our internal documentation
* Rate negotiation
* Boilerplate content

<h2 class="color--third">The last word</h2>

Thank you so much for reviewing this product proposal for your new finished-starter-based website! We hope it was a worthwhile
use of your time, and sincerely look forward to working with you.

One quick thing: All the products for sale on this site are packages of service hours. I will email a copy of _Solve it once_'s
Form W9 to all customers, and (noting that I'm not a lawyer or accountant and this isn't legal or financial advice) if you
pay _Solve it once_ $600 or more in a calendar year, you should submit a corresponding 1099.
