## Let's keep this brief

If you need a web developer and small business owner to do various and sundry work for you for 8-ish consecutive hours:

  * **Immediately** if the work you seek is remote (and Brad is awake)
  * **Tomorrow** (or whichever day you want thereafter) if you want Brad in your office

If you want Brad on-premise, we'd appreciate (but don't strictly require) hotel accommodations and transportation reimbursed
if your offices are more than 4 hours of driving away from Detroit.

## Work Brad could do for you

Brad can do a lot of web development and consultation stuff:

  * Clean up a hacked website for re-launch, within the practical limitations of a hacked site
  * Turn around a decent-sized Drupal or JAMstack site feature that your C-suite wants done yesterday
  * Create and launch a modest microsite
  * Improvise a training session on almost any Drupal or web development topic
  * Lead, or vigorously participate in, a strategy session for your company's technology approach
  * Review a decent amount of your documentation, put together a presentation, and present recommendations for overall improvements
  * Lead a pair-or-group programming exercise on your codebase, likely around refactoring key features for performance, security, or accessibility
  * Revise templates and boilerplate for common tasks, to improve productivity
  * General web development as needed
  * ...pretty much anything you need

If you're not sure Brad would be up for what you have in mind, [reach out](mailto:brad@solveitonce.com) and Brad will try
to get back to you quickly about what a day's high-priority work might look like.
