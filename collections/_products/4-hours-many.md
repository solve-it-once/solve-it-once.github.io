## Service description

If you need more than [a handful of hours of web development services](/products/work-by-the-hour/) but not
[a whole project's worth](/products/sprint/), you are in the right place.

A block (or bucket) of hours is available until completely used, and unlike other services for sale on the _so1ve_ site
these hours have no expiration date aside from the dissolution of _Solve it once_ if that were to ever occur.

If you do not yet have a set purpose for the hours but wish to reserve some for a later date, _Solve it once_ can keep track
of your remaining time balance. _Solve it once_ may be forced to raise hourly rates in the future, too, so preemptively
buying some hours now may save you some marginal cost.

Here are some examples of things you could have us accomplish inside of 10 hours:

* Automated reformatting of custom code in codebase, with manual block comments
* Migrate one or more content types from a legacy system
* Refresh/refine the frontend theme
* Do some copy and asset work, creating a mix of fixed and serialized content
* Create custom documentation for the site or brand/company
* Create a custom module for new functionality, within reason
* Do some user research and/or heuristic analysis with automated testing
* Add 1-3 content types to map your business's communication structure
* Improve perceived frontend performance and perform automated accessibility testing with some fixes
* Get a full strategy report and architecture for migrating/upgrading an existing morderate-sized legacy site to a new CMS
* ...and plenty more

Development hours can be used for anything within reason, as long as we're on the same page about the work being time-limited.
If you'd like to purchase a block of hours via the website and then request monthly invoicing for any hours used beyond
the initial purchase, we are happy to oblige.

If you anticipate creating a new site or doing a lot of work, [a Drupal website](/products/drupal-site/)
or [a full sprint of work](/products/sprint/) will be a better deal.

## What you can expect next

Once you use the checkout process, you'll hear from us via email:

1. You will receive an email at your billing contact address with a link to a brief form for the most vital information
   needed to start work, such as the site URL, access details for the codebase, any known details around setting up a development
   environment, and a quick write-up of the desired work
2. If we've worked together on this site before, _Solve it once_ can likely get started on the work, based entirely on your
   form responses. If this is your first time working with _so1ve_ or a site of yours we've never worked on, we'll likely
   have to follow up

Please note that blocks of hours are treated with less priority than full-site builds or larger
segments of work (but higher priority than single hours) that other clients purchase in a similar timeframe, so there may
be significant delays for this product. Whenever possible, _Solve it once_ will let you know of any changes to the estimated
delivery date of work hours.

## Your Satisfaction

We strive to deliver the best solutions to our clients’ needs at reasonable costs. If there’s a way we (an open, honest,
ethically-minded small business) can help improve your outcome without excessive cost to _Solve it once_, you need only
ask:

* Technology demonstrations
* Our internal documentation
* Rate negotiation
* Boilerplate content

<h2 class="color--third">The last word</h2>

Thank you so much for reviewing this product proposal for one or more web development hours. We hope it was a worthwhile
use of your time, and sincerely look forward to working with you.

One quick thing: All the products for sale on this site are packages of service hours. I will email a copy of _Solve it once_'s
Form W9 to all customers, and (noting that I'm not a lawyer or accountant and this isn't legal or financial advice) if you
pay _Solve it once_ $600 or more in a calendar year, you should submit a corresponding 1099.
